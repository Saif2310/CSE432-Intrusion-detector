# SQL Injection Detection using Finite State Machine (FSM)

This project implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for detecting **SQL injection attacks** in HTTP requests. It parses each HTTP request, extracts user inputs, and identifies potentially malicious patterns using a state-driven approach.

## ðŸš€ Project Description

SQL Injection is a common web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This project aims to **detect SQL injection attempts** in HTTP requests by simulating how an FSM processes the input and flags malicious content.

### Key Features

- Parses HTTP GET and POST requests
- Extracts query parameters and body content
- Simulates FSM to detect SQL injection patterns
- Classifies each request as either **malicious** or **clean**
- Designed to be extensible and educational

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.x
* Flask
* Flask-CORS

Installation
------------

1. Install the required Python packages:
   pip install Flask Flask-CORS



Notes
-----
* The FSM is designed to detect common SQL injection patterns. It may not detect all possible attack variations.
* This system is intended as a first line of defense and should be used in conjunction with other security measures.
* The client-side detection in index.html is a simplified simulation and should not be relied upon for production use. The server-side detection using the FSM is the primary detection mechanism.
